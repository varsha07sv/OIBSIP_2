                <strong>Rani Lakshmibai</strong> is an eternal symbol of bravery, strength, and resilience.  
                She defied societal norms, fought against injustice, and became an inspiration for women across generations.

                Rani Lakshmibai of Jhansi was a remarkable leader and a symbol of resistance against British rule during the Indian Rebellion of 1857. As the queen of Jhansi, she implemented progressive reforms, strengthened the military, and promoted women's empowerment. When the British refused to recognize her adopted son as the heir and annexed Jhansi under the Doctrine of Lapse, she fiercely opposed them. During the rebellion, she led her troops with extraordinary courage, fortifying Jhansi and later joining forces with Tatya Tope. Despite being outnumbered, she fought bravely in multiple battles, ultimately sacrificing her life in 1858. Her fearless leadership and dedication to India's freedom continue to inspire generations.
